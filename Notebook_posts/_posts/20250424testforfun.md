### CC experiments tutorial

***Before any experiment:***

**Use the enviroFlu to measure the PAH’s in the inspected water.**

**Control experiments conditions**

·    Clean sea water

·    Duration 20 min (5 min acclimation+15 experiment)

·    Flow rate 22.50 ml/min

·    One larvae 

·    Undivided chambers 

·    Uses only one from three dividers (on the very bottom position…?)

| Step | Action                                         |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1.   | Place dividers into the cc                     |
| 2.   | Fill up the water (200 ml/each  chamber)       |
| 3.   | Turn the pump in air bleeding mode             |
| 4.   | Turn on the pump in normal mode                |
| 5.   | Wait for 1 minute for the  circulation starts  |
| 6.   | Turn the camera on to the record  mode         |
| 7.   | Place the larvae in the random  side of the cc |
| 8.   | Cover the cc with the cardboard  box..         |
| 9.   | Let the experiment continues for  20 minutes   |

 

**General experiments conditions**

·    Contaminated sea water

·    Duration 20 min (5 min acclimation+15 experiment)

·    Flow rate 22.50 ml/min

·    One larvae 

·    Undivided chambers 

·    Uses only one from three dividers (on the very bottom position…?)

| Step | Action                                            |

| 7.   | Place the larvae in the **clean  side** of the cc |
| 8.   | Cover the cc with the cardboard  box..            |
| 9.   | Let the experiment continues for  20 minutes      |

 

questions…

1. What number of control/general experiments do we need to proceed?

2. Do we need a frame to use with enviroFlu while measuring contaminated/non contaminated water before exp?

3. Do we need a piece of black tissue (like we saw on the meeting with TRIOS) to use underneath the bucket with inspected water?
